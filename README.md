This is a work in progress as I get freetime to work on it I do. I am also a noob at python so if it ain't the cleanist code, that is why.

black_old.py is the V0 concept and blackjack.py is the current branch
file.py was me to learning more about the python file functions that will be removed later if not already
shuffle.py is a refrence python file for testing shuffling seed function using in the shuffleShoe()
